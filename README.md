# SPIRIT Consortium

The Structure for Packaging, Integrating and Re-using IP within Tool-flows (SPIRIT) consortium was created to develop a
standard for more efficient integration of IP in System-on-Chip (SoC) platform design in two areas: IP meta-data
description and a tool integration API.

SPIRIT Version 1.0 was released on December 8th, 2004 and addressed SoC design at the RT level. Work had already started
to draft Version 2.0 of the standard that was to extend the specification to cover comprehensive interoperability
between tools and explicit support of Electronic System Level (ESL) Design and Verification.

Around the time of DAC 2005, the IEEE P1685 working group was formed.
